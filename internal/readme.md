The internal folder in Go projects is used to hold packages that are intended to be used only within the project itself and not by external projects. This is a way to enforce encapsulation and prevent other projects from importing and using these internal packages.

These internal packages can be imported and used within the project, but they cannot be imported by code outside of the project. This helps in maintaining a clean and well-organized codebase.
